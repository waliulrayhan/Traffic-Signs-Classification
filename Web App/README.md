# Traffic Signs Classification Web Application

This repository contains the code for the **Traffic Signs Classification Web Application**, developed using Python, Flask, HTML, and Tailwind CSS. The project leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification, which identifies various types of traffic signs. The application provides a user-friendly web interface for uploading images and viewing the classification results.

## Overview

This project aims to assist in the identification and classification of traffic signs using a trained deep learning model. The web application is built to run the classification task seamlessly through a web browser, providing quick and accurate results. The CNN model used in this project is trained using Keras and TensorFlow on a dataset of traffic sign images.

## Features

- **Real-time Prediction:** The app displays the classified sign along with the probability score.
- **User Interface:** Built with Flask for backend services and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern frontend.
- **Model Persistence:** Uses a pre-trained model stored in `.p` format for efficient predictions.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
- **Data Handling and Visualization:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, OpenCV
- **Miscellaneous:** ImageDataGenerator for data augmentation, Pickle for model storage

## Usage

1. **Navigate to the web app** using the provided URL.
2. **View the classification results**, which include the identified class and the confidence level.

## Model Training

The CNN model used in this project was developed using the following methodology:

- **Dataset**: Composed of traffic sign images, labeled appropriately for classification.
- **Preprocessing Techniques**:
  - Conversion to grayscale for uniform image analysis.
  - Histogram equalization to standardize lighting.
  - Normalization of pixel values for better model performance.
- **Image Augmentation**:
  - Employed techniques such as zooming, shifting, and rotating to enhance model generalization.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Multiple convolutional layers paired with ReLU activation.
  - MaxPooling for feature map reduction.
  - Dropout layers to minimize overfitting.
  - Dense layers as the final decision-making layers with softmax activation for multi-class classification.

The training script can be found in `TrafficSigns_main.py`, and the real-time prediction script is in `TrafficSign_Test.py`.
